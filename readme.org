#+title: Fabric Prompts for gptel

[[https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric][fabric]] crowd sources prompts, [[https://github.com/karthink/gptel][gptel]] is a versatile LLM client for emacs. I wanted fabric prompts to be usable via gptel.

* Overview
 - pickup the fabric patterns subdirectory via a no-cone sparse checkout
 - offer completing reads for patterns that have a system prompt available
   - a pattern populator filters out directories that do not have a system.md
 - a completing read functionality then allows to hit gptel-send with the selected pattern, without altering your existing pattern
