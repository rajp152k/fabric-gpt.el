#+title: Fabric Prompts for gptel

[[https://github.com/danielmiessler/fabric][fabric]] crowd sources prompts, [[https://github.com/karthink/gptel][gptel]] is a versatile LLM client for emacs. I wanted fabric prompts to be usable via gptel.

Initial Expectations:

 - pass context via buffers, selections, groups of files, etc
 - pickup prompts via a helm like search


* Thoughts

 - can pickup the patterns directory from fabric into a local cache with timely checks for updates
